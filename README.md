## Proof of Correctness

One attribute examined in proving corrrectness was examining the consistancy of the output. Initially, the programm was running into race conditions, however, those where resolved by making counter variables only accessible through synchronized methods. 

Correctness can be examined by analyzing the implemented algorithm. The application utilizes a segmented sieve, where the number 100,000,000 is split into eight separate segments of size 12,500,000. The reason 100,000,000 is split into eight segments is so that one segment can run on each thread in parallel. 

First the application calculates a sieve for all primes from 1 to sqrt(100,000,000).

Second, the eight threads are created and assigned to one of the eight segments. 

Thrid, each thread starts and for the numbers in their segment, they perform the following

  1) get all primes from <lower limmit of segment> to sqrt(<upper limmit of segment>)
  2) For each prime (p) from (1), starting at p^2, mark all multiples of p that are within the range of the segment. 
  3) Examine all unmarked values in the segment and use them to produce the desired output. 
  
Forth, all threads are joined, and their results are combined to form the final output. 

This process ensures correctness by utilizing all threads and performing the calculations in such a way that thead i does not rely on information from thread j.

## Proof of Efficiency

To prove efficiency, the implemented algorithm was run against larger inputs (input is directly assigned to the variable N). Then, each thread was started and the time for each thread to perform the calculation was printed to the console. In addition to this, the total time taken to complete the program was calculated and printed to the console. Efficiency can be determined by examining these times and noting that each thread takes similar time to complete the task, and that the total run time is slightly more than the individual threadâ€™s time.

As shown for each test cases, the time it takes for each thread to complete is relatively close and indicates that work is being distributed evenly.


## Experimental Evaluation

Experimental evaluation was performed in part during the prof of efficiency, however, it was also performed by setting N to various multiple of eight (so there could be eight segments of numbers, 1 for each thread) and examining for consistency and correctness. 

One thing noted was that while each thread seems to be executing in relatively the same amount of time, the total execution time is still larger then the time it takes for a single thread to complete. After running multiple iterations, it seems that this additional overhead was caused by generating the initial state of the application in the main thread.
